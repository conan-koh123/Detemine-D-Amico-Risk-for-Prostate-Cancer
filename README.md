# Detemine Risk Classification for Prostate Cancer

This programme determines the risk classification (e.g. D Amico's Risk, NCCN Risk) of prostate cancer based on cT Staging, Gleason Score and PSA level at diagnosis of Prostate Cancer patients. It is written in Python 2.7.

For "Determine D amico risk for prostate cancer.py", it determines the risk classification based on cT Staging, Gleason Score and PSA level at diagnosis using D Amico's risk classification. For "Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Program.py" (Screenshots below), it classifies risk based on NCCN risk classification, with the function of further stratifying intermediate risk into favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk. In addition, it allows the calculation of duration based on a start date and a end date. This program is suitable in assisting the screening process of potential participants for clinical trials related to prostate cancer.
